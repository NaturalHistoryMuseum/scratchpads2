################################################
v2.2
24/April/2006 - Esteban Zimanyi and Mark Grimshaw
1/ A 4th array, $this->undefinedStrings, is now returned that holds field values that are judged to be undefined strings. i.e. they are a non-numeric value that is not defined in a @string{...} entry and not enclosed by braces or double-quotes. This array will be empty unless the following condition is met:
($this->removeDelimit || $this->expandMacro && $this->fieldExtract)
2/ When an undefined string is found in function removeDelimiters return the empty string. Return $this->undefinedStrings in the last position to allow compatibility with previous versions.
3/ Fix management of preamble in function returnArrays.
