Upgrade instructions from 6.x-1.3
================================
1) do not uninstall it if you want to keep the forms you already have protected in the database
2) delete the spamicide module directory but not the spamicide directory in files unless you don't
   mind rebuilding the form list or you are running a multisite
3) copy the new version to your sites/*/modules directory
4) enjoy
