Imagecache Actions 7.x-1.0 2012-05-19
-------------------------------------
Incompatabilities:
- Effects that operate on the transparency layer, do not automatically change
  the format anymore to png. You will have to add this as a separate effect.
- File handling: the way that files (e.g. fonts, watermarks, backgrounds) are
  searched for has been aligned over all effects that work with an additional
  file. This may cause current styles to not being able to find specified files
  anymore.

No changelog exists from before this 7.x-1.0 version. So the changelog starts
from here. 7.x-1.0 is the first reasonably well working D7 version. The 7.x-0.0
version was based on posted patches in the D7 port request issue and has never
been tested well. This 7.x-1.0 version is also not extensively tested by the
maintainers, but has been used in many (live) sites - currently (may 2012) over
5.000 reported 7.x-1.x-dev installs - so has received fairly good "test
coverage".
