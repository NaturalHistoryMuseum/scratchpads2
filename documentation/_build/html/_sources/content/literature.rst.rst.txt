   prefer), and fill out the fields given. Remember to link this
   bibliographic reference to your classification by filling in the
   TAXONOMIC NAME field.

   record or looking it up.

Edit a reference

   that entry. Click on the *Edit* tab.

2. You can now edit this individual entry, changing any of the fields
   that you consider to need changing.

3. Tag this biblio node to the classification by adding the respective
   term in the TAXONOMIC NAME field (`Autotagging`_ doesn’t work for
   bibio nodes). Only references that are linked to the classification
   will show up on your taxon pages. If you are using our training
   material, link the record you are editing to “Pediculus humanus”.
