Filtering taxonomic terms
=========================

Introduction
------------

You can use filters to temporarily ‘clean’ a classification from
unwanted terms. Some biological classifications include a lot of
synonyms, some times multiple times the volume of accepted names. You
may want to allow for users to temporarily browse only through the
accepted terms of a taxonomy. You can also allow the exclusion of terms
based on the rank they belong or the unacceptability reason.

Instructions
------------

1. While on the desired classification browsing page, click on the cog
   on the left top corner of the taxonomic tree

2. Select *Configure block*

   to add a filter to exclude all not accepted terms

   to add a filter to exclude all not accepted terms
